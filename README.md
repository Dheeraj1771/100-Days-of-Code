# 100-Days-of-Code
🚀 #DrGVishwanathan Challenge - 100 Days of Code 🚀
Welcome to my journey through the #DrGVishwanathan Challenge! This challenge is inspired by the popular 100 Days of Code, and I’m taking it up as part of an initiative from VIT Bhopal to sharpen my coding skills, solve new problems, and level up my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and more! 🧑‍💻💡

🎯 What is the #DrGVishwanathan Challenge?
The challenge is simple but powerful: for the next 100 days, I will be solving coding problems, learning new concepts, and improving my programming expertise. Each day will involve tackling a problem (or more!) from Leetcode, HackerRank, or other coding platforms, and documenting my progress right here!

🚀 Why This Challenge?
This journey is all about:

Strengthening problem-solving skills 🤔
Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms 💡
Learning new programming concepts every day 📚
Building a habit of coding consistently 🧠
Enhancing creativity in tackling challenges 🎨
🌟 Outcome of the Challenge
By the end of this challenge, I aim to:

Solve 100+ coding problems 🏅
Sharpen my coding proficiency in Java, Python, and other languages 💻
Master key DSA concepts 🌐
Develop a strong coding habit that lasts beyond the challenge 🧑‍🏫
Create a resource for other coders to follow along and learn! 🔥
💻 Track My Progress
Each day, I’ll update this repository with the problems I’ve solved, the approach I took, and what I learned along the way. Feel free to follow my journey!

Day	Problem	Solution	Learning
Day 1/100	Contains Duplicate	Java Solution	Arrays, Hashing
Day 2/100	Concatenation of Array	Java Solution	Efficient Array Manipulation
🎉 Join the Journey!
Feel free to clone this repository, solve the problems, and improve your skills alongside me! Together, we can become better coders, one problem at a time. 🌟

Let’s keep the momentum going! 🚀
